Pairs trading is a popular investment strategy that aims to exploit relative price inefficiencies between two co-moving assets. Traditionally, this strategy has relied on statistical methods to identify suitable pairs for trading. However, with the advancements in machine learning, researchers and practitioners have recognized the potential of integrating machine learning techniques into pairs trading strategies to enhance their performance and profitability. Hence, the current project aims to explore the integration of machine learning techniques into pairs trading strategies leveraging the Fama & French 3 (three) Factors.
